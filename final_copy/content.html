            <p class="para">Ever since I was in grade school I would watch youtubers and content creators. I still haven't found just one thing to do but I'm really good at videogames and I'ma always bring the energy. I love playing horror games, a few competitive games, or anything I can make content with. Though I love playing games, I like to explore my acting side as well. Occasionally I'll drop some skits or edits that will get better every time I upload... Hopefully. Furthermore, I like to document the things I do. And not always the good things. I like to capture many aspects of my life to show people, although we're all different and unique, we really aren't that different as we all go through struggles and it's our first time at this life thing.</p>

            <p class="para">Another passion I have is music! Not just listening to it, but making it. I started when I was a kid but never took the proper steps of learning until I was much older and realized I had potential. I make my songs straight from my phone with some apple earbuds, and I'll either be in my room or my car. Recently I realized, I'm going to make music no matter what anyone says or how bad I think it might sound. Wether they like it or hate it. Or wether they think it'll never go anywhere. I do it because I love it and I always will. I'm in the process of getting the songs I have available released, so for now all I have to show is this;
